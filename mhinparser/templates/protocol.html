            <ul>
                <li>For aesthetic reasons. To make each transaction not just a financial operation, but a brushstroke in the blockchain's grand canvas of mathematical beauty.</li>
                <li>These cascading patterns of zeros would not only create beauty but could also enhance compression, potentially streamlining the blockchain's storage and processing efficiency.</li>
                <li>Anyone can earn MHIN by creating beautiful transactions - no single-winner-per-block like in Bitcoin block mining!</li>
                <li>If successful, MHIN tokens could eventually reimburse transaction fees - rewarding those who make nice looking transactions!</li>

            <h3 class="subtitle2">MHIN mining</h3>
            <p>
                To mine MHIN you must broadcast a Bitcoin transaction whose txid starts with at least 6 zeros.
                The reward is calculated based on how your transaction compares to the nicest transaction in the block:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a given block, transactions starting with the most zeros earn 4096 MHIN</li>
                <li>Transactions with one zero less than the best transactions earn 4096/16 or 256 MHIN</li>
                <li>Transactions with two fewer zeros earn 4096 / 16 /16 or 16 MHIN</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formula used is therefore as follows:</p>
            <code>
                reward = 4096 / 16 ^ (max_zero_count - zero_count)
            </code>
            <p>
                With `max_zero_count` equal to the number of zeros which start the best transaction 
                and `zero_count` the number of zeros which start the transaction for which we calculate the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Coinbase transactions are not eligible for MHIN rewards.

            <h3 class="subtitle2">MHIN distribution</h3>
            <p>
                MHINs earned with a transaction starting with 6 or more zeros are distributed to UTXOs.
                The distribution is carried out as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a single non-OP_RETURN UTXO it receives the entire reward.</li>
                <li>If there are two or more non-OP_RETURN UTXOs, the reward is distributed to all UTXOs, except the last one, in proportion to the value of each UTXO</li>
                <li>The calculations being made only with integers, the possible remainder of the division is distributed to the first non-OP_RETURN UTXO.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, if a transaction earning 256 MHIN contains 4 outputs with 500, 500, 500 and 2000 Satoshis respectively, the first output receives 86 MHIN of the reward, the second and third 85 MHIN.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h3 class="subtitle2">Moving MHIN</h3>
            <p>
                When UTXOs with attached MHINs are spent, the MHINs are distributed to the new UTXOs in the transaction.
                Distribution is done in exactly the same way as rewards.
