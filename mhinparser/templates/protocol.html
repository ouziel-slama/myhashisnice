            <ul>
                <li>For aesthetic reasons. To make each transaction not just a financial operation, but a brushstroke in the blockchain's grand canvas of mathematical beauty.</li>
                <li>These cascading patterns of zeros would not only create beauty but could also enhance compression, potentially streamlining the blockchain's storage and processing efficiency.</li>
                <li>Anyone can earn MHIN by creating beautiful transactions - no single-winner-per-block like in Bitcoin block mining!</li>
                <li>If successful, MHIN tokens could eventually reimburse transaction fees - rewarding those who make nice looking transactions!</li>

            <h3 class="subtitle2">MHIN mining</h3>
            <p>
                To mine MHIN you must broadcast a Bitcoin transaction whose txid starts with at least 6 zeros.
                The reward is calculated based on how your transaction compares to the nicest transaction in the block:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a given block, transactions starting with the most zeros earn 4096 MHIN</li>
                <li>Transactions with one zero less than the best transactions earn 4096/16 or 256 MHIN</li>
                <li>Transactions with two fewer zeros earn 4096 / 16 /16 or 16 MHIN</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The formula used is therefore as follows:</p>
            <code>
                reward = 4096 / 16 ^ (max_zero_count - zero_count)
            </code>
            <p>
                With `max_zero_count` equal to the number of zeros which start the best transaction 
                and `zero_count` the number of zeros which start the transaction for which we calculate the reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Coinbase transactions are not eligible for MHIN rewards.

            <h3 class="subtitle2">MHIN distribution</h3>
            <p>
                MHINs earned with a transaction starting with 6 or more zeros are distributed to UTXOs.
                The distribution is carried out as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is a single non-OP_RETURN UTXO it receives the entire reward.</li>
                <li>If there are two or more non-OP_RETURN UTXOs, the reward is distributed to all UTXOs, except the last one, in proportion to the value of each UTXO</li>
                <li>The calculations being made only with integers, the possible remainder of the division is distributed to the first non-OP_RETURN UTXO.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, if a transaction earning 256 MHIN contains 4 outputs with 500, 500, 500 and 2000 Satoshis respectively, the first output receives 86 MHIN of the reward, the second and third 85 MHIN.

            <h3 class="subtitle2">Moving MHIN</h3>
            <p>
                When UTXOs with attached MHINs are spent, the MHINs are distributed to the new UTXOs in the transaction.
                There are two methods for distributing MHINs when moving them:
            </p>
            
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold;">Method 1: Automatic Proportional Distribution</h4>
            <p>
                By default, distribution is done in exactly the same way as rewards - proportionally based on the Bitcoin values of the output UTXOs, excluding the last output if there are multiple outputs.
            </p>
            
            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold;">Method 2: Custom Distribution via OP_RETURN</h4>
            <p>
                You can now specify exactly how MHINs should be distributed by including an OP_RETURN output in your transaction with custom distribution data. This allows for precise control over MHIN transfers.
            </p>
            
            <h5 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold;">OP_RETURN Format:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The OP_RETURN script must contain data that starts with the 4-byte prefix "MHIN"</li>
                <li>Following the prefix, the data must be encoded in CBOR format</li>
                <li>The CBOR data should represent a vector of unsigned 64-bit integers (Vec&lt;u64&gt;)</li>
                <li>Each integer specifies how many MHINs to send to the corresponding output UTXO</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold;">Distribution Rules:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of values in the distribution array is automatically adjusted to match the number of non-OP_RETURN outputs</li>
                <li>If the array is too long, extra values are removed</li>
                <li>If the array is too short, zeros are appended</li>
                <li>The total sum of the distribution values cannot exceed the total MHINs being spent</li>
                <li>If the sum is less than the total, the difference is added to the first output</li>
                <li>If the sum exceeds the total, the transaction falls back to proportional distribution</li>
                <li>Newly mined MHIN rewards are always distributed proportionally and then combined with the custom distribution</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; font-weight: bold;">Example:</h5>
            <p>
                If you have 1000 MHINs to distribute across 3 outputs and want to send 600 to the first, 300 to the second, and 100 to the third, your OP_RETURN would contain "MHIN" followed by the CBOR encoding of [600, 300, 100].
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                <b>Note:</b> If no valid OP_RETURN distribution is found, the transaction automatically uses the proportional distribution method.
